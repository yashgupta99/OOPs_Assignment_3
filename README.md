# OOPs_Assignment_3 & Testing Assignment

In this project I solved the problem which is :

Create a User Management System.

Application
--------------
2 Types of Users:
a) Customer
b) Admins


Acceptance Criteria (Demo) :
1. Create a Main class under `org.knoldus.bootstarp` and perform following operator.
a. Create two User [Customer and Admin]
b. List all user
c. Update UserName of Admin
d. Delete Customer

So, according to above problem I created  User management System which has following structure:-

=>src
	main
		scala
			org
				knoldus
					bootstrap
						-Main.class
					databse
						-UserDatabase.scala
					model
						-User.Scala
						-UserType.scala
					repository
						dao
							-Dao.scala
					Service
						-UserService.scala
	test
		scala
			org
				knoldus
					database
						-UserDatabaseTest.scala
					service
						-UserServiceUnitTest
						-UserServiceIntegrationTest

where every scala class doing its job.

For the Testing coverage I used the scoverage plugin

the result by the scoverage :-

[info] Statement coverage.: 91.23%
[info] Branch coverage....: 85.00%
[info] Coverage reports completed
[info] All done. Coverage was [91.23%]
